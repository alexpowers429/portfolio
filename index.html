My inspiration behind this app was similar to why I got into web development, the prospect of being able to do meaningful work FROM HOME! I pushed myself with this app by trying my best to make it both functional and stylish. Who knows, maybe whoever is reading this is a hiring manager from a job that I applied to on this app! </p>

Myself and 3 other devs built this app in a 10 day sprint. My main focus was getting a functional backend up and running as quickly as possible. I had another dev helping me out with Express and MonggoDB. After completing the backend I helped design the app with React, CSS, and bootstrap.</p>
